# TikTok Followers Animation

I had an idea of animating my TikTok followers number the moment i hit/reach the 5000 followers milistone.

The drop back was some sites were paying for and if not there was no program to do that.

So I came up with a simple program using HTML(markup), CSS(flexbox layout) and  Javascript(Animation).
